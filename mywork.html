        <h3>In barotrauma you explore Europa's oceans in a submarine. During missions you often leave your sub and put</h3>
        <h3> on a diving suit. I created a custom diving suit based off the Iron Man Hammerhead Suit. It took me about a</h3>
        <h3> week to finish. I had to create a model, learn xml, and do a lot of messing around and finding out. I never </h3>
        <h3> finished the mod. After 90% completion I was too burnt out to polish it. My friends also lost interest in the</h3>
        <h3> game so I had even less motivation to complete the mod. The workshop description needs to be updated, it works. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3094451325">Steam Workshop Link</h3></a></body>
